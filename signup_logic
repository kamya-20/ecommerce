// const idToken = response.credential;

// This is NOT your backend JWT.
// This is the Google ID token generated by Google when the user signs in via Google’s OAuth.
// response.credential comes from the Google Identity Services SDK, and it’s essentially proof from Google:
// "This person has signed in with their Google account and here’s their identity information."

// You send the Google ID token to your backend.
// Your backend will verify this Google ID token by contacting Google’s servers (or using a library like google-auth-library).
// If Google confirms the token is valid, then your backend will:
// Find or create the user in your database.
// Generate your own JWT (jwt.sign) for your app.
// Send your JWT to the frontend (usually in a cookie).
// Later requests from frontend → backend will use your app’s JWT, not Google’s token.
